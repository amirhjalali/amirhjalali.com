# UI Improvements V2

## Issues to Address

### 1. Hero Animation - CRITICAL
- [ ] Current AMIR animation is still bad
- [ ] Either remove animation completely or make it genuinely smooth
- [ ] Consider: just static "AMIR" text, no animation at all
- [ ] Alternative: smooth fade between AMIR and "MR AI" with proper timing

### 2. Button Styling Consistency
- [ ] Check all button hover states
- [ ] Ensure rounded-full is consistent everywhere
- [ ] Verify shadow effects work well in both modes
- [ ] Check button text contrast in light mode

### 3. Card Design Improvements
- [ ] Project cards - improve spacing and hierarchy
- [ ] Thought cards - reduce clutter, simplify design
- [ ] Remove or simplify thought bubble "tails" (might be too gimmicky)
- [ ] Better image aspect ratios

### 4. Navigation Polish
- [ ] Mobile menu styling
- [ ] Active state indicators
- [ ] Hover effects smoothness

### 5. Typography & Spacing
- [ ] Check heading sizes consistency
- [ ] Verify paragraph spacing
- [ ] Ensure proper visual hierarchy on all pages

### 6. Overall Polish
- [ ] Remove any remaining busy animations
- [ ] Simplify particle effects or remove them
- [ ] Clean, minimal aesthetic
- [ ] Fast, smooth, professional
