A few months back, I wrote about the promise of vibe coding. Now, 2.5 months into practicing it daily, I still believe the nature of programming has shifted. But I'm also seeing the current limits more clearly.

The biggest friction point comes when a project needs to interact with external data. Whether it's a database or API calls, progress slows down significantly. This happens regardless of the model being used.

Right now, the best move is to delay database integration. In the early stages, the data model needs to stay flexible. File-based formats like JSON work better and are easier for the LLM to navigate. Once you involve a real database, errors become more frequent and the process becomes much harder to manage.

Keep it local as long as possible. That's where vibe coding still flows.`,

Open AI recently released their 4o image generation model. GPT-4o image model differs from previous diffusion models in that it is:

• **Multimodal-native**: Unlike diffusion models that generate images from text prompts only, 4o can directly understand and generate across text, images, and audio in a unified architecture.

• **Non-diffusion-based**: It doesn't use a step-by-step denoising process like Stable Diffusion or DALL·E 2. Instead, image reasoning and generation are integrated more like language modeling, allowing for faster and more flexible interaction.

This has led to a giant step up in usability of this model. The long prompts of Midjourney days are gone and we can now collaborate more closely with the model for our desired outputs.

Vibe coding is a new paradigm from early 2025 which essentially refers to writing software with the help of LLMS, without actually writing any of the code yourself.

As the videos below demonstrate, this is not something that is just for a junior programmer. Many seasoned programmers are moving over to this paradigm as the efficiency gains are just incomparable to writing code by themselves.

As of current, a technical background and systems thinking is still helpful to guide the development process. Nonetheless the difference between what it meant to be a programmer 2 years ago till today is quite whiplash inducing.

Vibe Coding in 2025 will do to software what MidJourney has done for image generation since 2023. Meaning there will be a massive amount of output, but getting to a final shippable product will still required tenacity and reliance on traditional skills.`,

DeepSeek-R1 represents a major breakthrough in AI development, not just for its impressive performance but for the significant cost reductions it introduces. Unlike many large-scale models that require massive computational resources, DeepSeek has managed to develop a model on par with OpenAI's leading systems at a fraction of the cost. This efficiency makes high-performance AI more accessible, opening doors for businesses, researchers, and developers who previously faced prohibitive expenses when integrating advanced AI into their work.

By dramatically lowering the cost of AI inference and training, DeepSeek-R1 could drive widespread adoption across industries, from healthcare and finance to education and creative fields. Companies that once relied on expensive proprietary models may now have access to open-source alternatives without compromising on quality. This shift not only democratizes AI but also increases competition, pushing the industry toward more sustainable and cost-effective innovation. If this trend continues, AI deployment could become significantly cheaper, leading to a future where high-quality AI assistance is a standard tool rather than a luxury reserved for the largest tech companies.

        content: `# REASONING MODELS

Chain of Thought (CoT) prompting has already proven to be a powerful method for improving the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) by breaking down complex problems into intermediate logical steps. This approach not only enhances accuracy but also makes AI decision-making more transparent and interpretable.

OpenAI's latest research on Learning to Reason with LLMs builds on this idea, demonstrating that explicit reasoning techniques—such as self-reflection, verification, and structured problem-solving—can further optimize AI performance. Instead of merely predicting an answer based on surface-level patterns, LLMs can be trained to reason step by step, much like a human working through a problem.

By integrating reasoning models with CoT, we move toward AI systems that don't just generate responses but actively "think" through challenges in a structured way. This has major implications for fields that require rigorous logical processing, such as mathematics, scientific research, law, and medical diagnostics. More importantly, these techniques reduce hallucinations, improve reliability, and offer insights into how AI reaches its conclusions, making AI systems more trustworthy and effective for complex tasks.

The concept of Test-Time Compute (TTC) allows AI more processing time to refine reasoning during inference, optimizing processing depth rather than relying solely on model size.`,

Chain of Thought (CoT) is a prompting technique that guides language models to solve complex problems by breaking them down into intermediate reasoning steps. This approach improves AI accuracy by providing structured logical deduction and makes AI decision-making more transparent and interpretable.

The technique allows models to process complex queries more effectively and can help smaller models outperform larger ones through better reasoning. Rather than jumping directly to conclusions, CoT prompting encourages the AI to show its work, much like a student solving a math problem step by step.

This pedagogical approach to AI interaction represents a shift toward more collaborative and understandable AI systems, where the reasoning process becomes as important as the final answer.`,
