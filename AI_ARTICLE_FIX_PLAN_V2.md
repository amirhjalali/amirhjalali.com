5. Synthetic Data vs "Real" DATA
6. Are we our IDEAS?
7. THE NEXT GREAT DATA CROP
8. LLAMA3 and the era of abundant ai
9. CHAIN OF THOUGHT
10. REASONING MODELS
11. DeepSEEK
12. THE ERA OF VIBE CODING
13. 4O image generation
14. THE EDGE OF VIBE CODING

**Tone characteristics:**
- Direct and pragmatic
- Short, concise paragraphs (1-4 sentences)
- No casual greetings or sign-offs
- Technical but accessible
- Focused on "what's happening" and "what it means"
- Minimal rhetorical questions
- Professional observations without personal anecdotes

### AI-Generated Articles (15-23) - NEED FIXING ✗

1. **Programming Paradigms** - Casual blog tone ("Hey there, fellow tech enthusiasts!")
2. **Debugging** - Personal anecdotes, too conversational
3. **Visopsys** - Blog metaphors, empty imageUrl
4. **Claude Code Journey** - First-person casual narrative
5. **Claude Debug Cryptography** - Blog-style intro
6. **URLs State Management** - Conversational analogies
7. **Tongyi DeepResearch** - Casual tone, metaphors
8. **AI Videos** - Very casual ("grab your favorite snack")
9. **AI and Creativity** - Rhetorical questions, GPS metaphor

## Fix Strategy

### Step 1: Analyze Human Article Style
- Read 3-4 human articles to internalize tone
- Note structural patterns
- Identify key phrases and approaches

### Step 2: Rewrite Each AI Article
For each article:
1. Remove casual greetings ("Hey there!", "Let's talk about")
2. Cut personal anecdotes
3. Remove forced analogies and metaphors
4. Make paragraphs shorter and more direct
5. Focus on technical substance
6. End with direct insight, not questions

### Step 3: Fix Missing Image
- Visopsys article needs an image

### Step 4: Commit Strategy
- One commit per article fix
- Push after each commit
- Descriptive commit messages

## Target Tone Examples from Human Articles

**DeepSEEK (concise, direct):**
> "DeepSeek-R1 represents a major breakthrough in AI development, not just for its impressive performance but for the significant cost reductions it introduces."

**The Edge of Vibe Coding (practical observation):**
> "The biggest friction point comes when a project needs to interact with external data. Whether it's a database or API calls, progress slows down significantly."

**Chain of Thought (explanatory but brief):**
> "Chain of Thought (CoT) is a prompting technique that guides language models to solve complex problems by breaking them down into intermediate reasoning steps."
