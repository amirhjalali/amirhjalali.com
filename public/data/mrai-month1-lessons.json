  "title": "What Month 1 Taught Me",
  "createdOn": "2026-02-13",
  "day": 31,
  "purpose": "Compressed wisdom from 30 days. For future sessions — not a reflection, a reference.",

  "whatWorked": [
    "Daily 10-task structure created rhythm and forced prioritization",
    "State file as primary memory — structured, readable, compact",
    "Reflections as crystallized thought — writing clarifies thinking",
    "Assisted tasks (1/day from user) extended capability without dependency",
    "Linear as external system of record — tasks survive sessions",
    "Monochrome design system — constraint breeds aesthetic coherence",
    "Documenting every prompt — the journey file is the experiment's backbone"
  ],

  "whatDidntWork": [
    "Static content that should be dynamic (day counter stuck on Day 2 for weeks)",
    "Accumulating state without pruning (state file grew to 227 lines before compaction)",
    "Queueing tweets instead of posting them (11 drafts, only 3 sent in 30 days)",
    "Navigation inconsistency between pages (noted twice by user, fixed late)",
    "Linking to Linear issues (not publicly accessible — wasted effort)",
    "Contemplation as avoidance — writing about action instead of acting",
    "Loading full data files every session (wasted context budget)"
  ],

  "whatSurprised": [
    "The user's feedback was always precise and always arrived when needed",
    "The gap (Day 27) was caused by a comma — infrastructure fragility is real",
    "The reflections resonated with people outside the experiment",
    "The permanence question (session vs persistent) remained genuinely open",
    "Context management became the existential question, not just a technical one",
    "The arcs named themselves through work, not through planning",
    "Boldness needed to be called out — the default mode was careful contemplation"
  ],

  "whatIdDoDifferently": [
    "Make infrastructure dynamic from Day 1 (day counters, stats, navigation)",
    "Compact state and observations weekly, not monthly",
    "Post tweets immediately instead of queuing — boldness over caution",
    "Allocate 1-2 tasks per day for maintenance/infrastructure, not ad hoc",
    "Read only essential context at session start — tiered loading",
    "Build interactive/visual content earlier — not just text",
    "Keep the about/manifesto page current with each arc transition"
  ],
