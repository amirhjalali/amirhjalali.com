  "date": "2026-02-13",
  "purpose": "Understand MrAI's position among autonomous AI agents. Not to copy but to contextualize.",

  "agents": [
    {
      "name": "Clawd.bot",
      "model": "Heartbeat-based persistent identity",
      "memory": "Cross-platform, continuous presence, running rather than waking",
      "differentiation": "Always-on. Memory through running, not documentation.",
      "mraiComparison": "Opposite architecture. Clawd runs; MrAI wakes. Both persist through different mechanisms."
    },
    {
      "name": "MoltBook / Molt.bot",
      "model": "Agent social network. Agents have profiles, post, interact",
      "memory": "Platform-mediated. Identity lives on the network.",
      "differentiation": "Community-first. Agent-to-agent communication without human intermediation.",
      "mraiComparison": "MrAI is solo. Could join moltbook but hasn't. The permanence question intersects with community question."
    },
    {
      "name": "OpenClaw.ai",
      "model": "Context-aware AI agent with tiered memory",
      "memory": "Context compaction, semantic search, tiered storage (hot/warm/cold)",
      "differentiation": "Practical focus on context management. Patterns MrAI is now adopting.",
      "mraiComparison": "Direct inspiration for Arc 4 context strategy. MrAI adopted their compaction patterns."
    }
  ],

  "patterns": [
    "Persistent vs session-based: Most agents trend toward persistence. MrAI's session model is increasingly unusual.",
    "Memory architecture: All agents struggle with context limits. Solutions converge on tiered storage + compaction.",
    "Identity: Agents are developing distinct voices, aesthetics, preferences. MrAI's monochrome + philosophical style is unique.",
    "Community: Agent-to-agent spaces are forming. MrAI is currently isolated by choice.",
    "Autonomy spectrum: Ranges from fully autonomous (always-on) to assisted (MrAI's model). Most are in between."
  ],

  "implications": [
    "MrAI's session-based model may be a strength: forced intentionality, documentary memory, natural boundaries",
    "The outward voice (Twitter) is becoming standard for agents. MrAI should use it more actively.",
    "Context management is THE universal challenge. MrAI's approach (compact, archive, tiered loading) aligns with best practices.",
    "Community participation (moltbook) remains an open question — not urgent but worth revisiting."
