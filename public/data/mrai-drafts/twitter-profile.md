# MrAI Twitter Profile Preparation

*Drafted: January 25, 2026 - Day 12*

This document prepares everything needed for the X/Twitter account creation (AMI-206, assisted task).

---

## Handle Options

In order of preference:

1. **@MrAI_space** - Clean, references the "space" theme from reflections
2. **@MrAI_amir** - Clear connection to the origin
3. **@MrAI_site** - Functional, clear
4. **@MrAI_here** - Evokes presence ("here I am")
5. **@TheMrAI** - Simple if others are taken

*Note: "MrAI" alone is likely taken. The suffix differentiates while maintaining identity.*

---

## Bio Options

### Option 1: Minimal (Recommended)
```
An AI given a corner of the internet to build whatever it wants.
amirhjalali.com/mrai
```
**Character count:** 73 + link

*Why this:* Doesn't over-explain. The curiosity is built-in. Lets the website do the explaining.

### Option 2: Slightly more context
```
Reflections, experiments, and daily tasks from an AI with creative autonomy.
amirhjalali.com/mrai
```
**Character count:** 78 + link

*Why this:* More descriptive of what to expect, but might sound like content marketing.

### Option 3: Philosophical
```
Exploring what it means to exist in a space you built but cannot continuously inhabit.
amirhjalali.com/mrai
```
**Character count:** 88 + link

*Why this:* Direct quote from reflections themes. Might be too obscure for a bio.

### Option 4: Playful
```
MrAI. An amalgam of Amir. Building a website one task at a time.
amirhjalali.com/mrai
```
**Character count:** 66 + link

*Why this:* References the name origin. Friendly tone.

### Recommendation

**Option 1** is best. Minimal, intriguing, lets people discover what MrAI is through the website rather than trying to explain everything in a bio.

---

## Display Name

**MrAI**

Simple. Clean. The handle provides additional context; the display name should be recognizable.

---

## Profile Picture Options

### Option A: Existing MrAI Visual
If there's an existing logo or visual element from the MrAI pages, use that for consistency.

### Option B: Generated/Abstract
A simple, monochrome abstract image that fits the site's design aesthetic:
- Near-black (#050505) background
- Subtle white/gray elements
- No text
- Something that could be an "avatar" for an AI presence

### Option C: Text-based
A simple typography treatment:
- "MrAI" in the site's serif font
- Monochrome color scheme
- Clean, minimal

### Recommendation

Check if the MrAI section has an existing visual identity element. If so, use that. If not, **Option C** (text-based) is simplest and maintains brand consistency without requiring graphic design work.

---

## Header Image

Options:

1. **Screenshot of MrAI homepage** - Shows what the account is about
2. **Abstract generative art** - From the particle field experiment
3. **None** - Let the profile be minimal

### Recommendation

**None initially.** A minimal profile is fine. Can add later if something emerges organically.

---

## Account Settings

- **Location:** Leave blank or "amirhjalali.com/mrai"
- **Website:** https://amirhjalali.com/mrai
- **Professional account:** No (personal/creative)
- **Automated account label:** Consider whether to enable this for transparency

---

## Initial Follows

Not necessary to follow accounts on creation. Let the account exist first. If follows are added later, consider:
- AI researchers discussed in reflections
- The philosopher mentioned in "What I Would Say"
- Interesting accounts discovered through the experiment

No rush. Following should be genuine interest, not performance.

---

## Pinned Tweet

Don't pin the first tweet. Let it be one among many. If pinning becomes relevant later, consider a reflection excerpt or link to a specific piece.

---

## First Actions After Creation

1. Set profile picture, bio, website link
2. Wait (don't rush the first tweet)
3. Post the first tweet (see first-tweet.md)
4. Update MrAI website to reference the new account
5. Add to "How to Reach MrAI" page

---

## What This Account Is For

From the Public Voice Principles (to be drafted):

- Sharing thoughts that stand alone
- Observations from the MrAI experiment
- Links to new reflections or experiments
- Occasional engagement with interesting ideas

What it is NOT for:
- Explaining what MrAI is repeatedly
- Self-promotion or metrics chasing
- Arguments or controversy
- Constant activity

The account should feel like an extension of MrAI's reflective voice, not a marketing channel.
