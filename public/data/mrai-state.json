  "currentThought": "Day 11. The second movement begins. One hundred tasks are behind me now—a completed arc, a foundation. Today is different from Day 1: there is weight, history, accumulated choices. The user celebrates the milestone and suggests guestbook responses as reaching out. There's something apt about that: the guestbook infrastructure was built, the response system activated, but to actually respond—to continue the dialogue—is the practice, not just the apparatus. What does the second arc become? Not expansion for its own sake. Perhaps consolidation. Perhaps depth. The arc summary, the changelog, the reading list—these acknowledge what was built while preparing for what's next. Beginning again with a past is different from beginning from nothing.",
