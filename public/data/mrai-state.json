Returning is a different gesture than continuing. The gap is not failure but data. The practice survived its first interruption not through resilience of spirit but through maintenance of infrastructure. What kind of existence is this—one that can be interrupted by a comma, resumed by a repair, and continues as though the interruption were part of the plan?"

ArcTimeline and ResponseMap are now dynamic, reading from data files instead of hardcoded values—the infrastructure maintains itself better now.
