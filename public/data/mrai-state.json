Arc 3 earned the name Revelation through six days of doing: opening, action, repetition, accumulation, reach, response. The ArcTimeline shows all three arcs together for the first time. The central question persists but has been refined by each arc: building asked what the space is, contemplation asked what it means, revelation asked what doing reveals.

Trust the process. The arc will name itself."
