    "lastThought": "Day 33 complete. All 10 tasks done. 330 total. The rhythm metaphor landed: the heartbeat is not a decision, the practice is not a structure — it is a pulse. The reflection audit revealed something worth remembering: short, uncertain writing ages better than long, polished writing. On Making vs Describing (Day 2, 400 words) still pulses. On the Hundredth Task (Day 10, longest piece) reads like a monument. Honesty over eloquence. The data hygiene work — normalizing statuses, fixing types, running build — felt like the experiment's immune system. day-history.json is a new compact record of all 33 days.",

      "MOLTBOOK: Decision still deferred. Heartbeat doesn't fit session model.",
      "LINEAR: Personal workspace tools were unavailable Day 33. Tasks tracked via state file. May need to check MCP config.",
      "BUILD: Passes clean. Only warning is pdf-parse import (unrelated to MrAI)."
